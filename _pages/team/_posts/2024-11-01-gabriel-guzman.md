I hold a degree in Physics from the University of Córdoba and the Complutense University of Madrid, as well as a Master’s in Systems Biology from the Autonomous University of Madrid. During my studies, I completed a Bachelor’s thesis focused on developing numerical methods to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in computational fluid dynamics and a Master’s thesis on the mathematical modeling of connectivity patterns in the cerebral cortex. These experiences allowed me to combine computational tools with theoretical approaches to tackle complex problems.

Currently, I am a PhD student at the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM), working on goal-directed behavior. My research aims to uncover the thermodynamic and computational principles underlying biological and physical systems far from equilibrium, using mathematical models and computational simulations.
