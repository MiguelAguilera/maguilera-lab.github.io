I am a postdoctoral fellow at [BCAM](https://www.bcamath.org/en) working under supervision of Miguel Aguilera. My research interest lies in studying nonlinear phenomena arising in applications in such fields as biophysics, neuroscience and machine learning. The main results of my research concern emergence of chaotic and hyperchatic regimes and bifurcation chains leading to their appearance. I also study appearance and deustruction of synchronization in models of nonlinear oscillators. I am currently working on dynamics of mean fields, describing macroscopic activity patterns in Hopfield networks.[
