I am a PhD student at the [Basque Center for Aplied Mathematics(BCAM)](https://www.bcamath.org/) under the supervision of [Miguel Aguilera](https://maguilera.net/). I hold a BSc in Physics and an MSc in Computational Chemisttry, both from the [University of Cantabria (UC)](https://web.unican.es/centros/ciencias). 

For my [bachelor's thesis](https://repositorio.unican.es/xmlui/handle/10902/21070) I collaborated with the UC's [Condensed Matter Group](https://web.unican.es/departamentos/citimac), focusing on the simulation of phase transitions in ferroelectric materials such as strontium titanate (SrTiO3). On the other hand, my master's thesis involved working with the [Biochemical Engineering Department](https://web.unican.es/departamentos/ingquimica), performing [DFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory) simulations to assess the viability of organic extractants regarding the extraction of lithium from seawater desalination brines. Our findings were published in [this journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001191642200159X).

Before embarking on my PhD, I spent a year at BCAM as a research technician in the Machine Learning group, where I provided data science consultancy and conducted deep learning research, particularly on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Currently, my research interests lie at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neuroscience, information theory, and machine learning. My PhD thesis aims to understand and characterize the behavior of spiking neural networks (SNNs) using non-equilibrium spin models. By developing these models, we hope to gain valuable insights into the dynamical operation of SNNs and potentially discover new learning algorithms, addressing one of the critical challenges in current SNN research.
