### About the Research Group

Our research group is part of the [Mathematical, Computational and Experimental Neuroscience (MCEN)](https://www.bcamath.org/en/research/areas/m3a/mcen) area at [BCAM -- Basque Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.bcamath.org/). We explore the adaptive properties of biological and artificial systems through an interdisciplinary approach that integrates statistical mechanics, information theory, machine learning, and nonlinear dynamics.

Our work focuses on understanding how intelligent agents interact with their environments, with a particular emphasis on neural systems viewed as open, nonequilibrium systems. Drawing on tools from nonequilibrium physics, we pursue two main research directions:

1. Investigating the statistical physics of neural networks and other complex adaptive systems to uncover the principles that govern their behavior and organization.

1. Studying the interplay between nonequilibrium thermodynamics, information theory, and the emergence of agency and autonomous behavior in both living and artificial systems.

Through these efforts, we aim to address open theoretical challenges in neuroscience, theoretical biology, and artificial intelligence, while contributing to a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of life, cognition, and agency.
